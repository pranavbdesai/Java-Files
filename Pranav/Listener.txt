Event Handling

For that we have to import  java.awt.event.*; package.

We have some interface (Listener) for performing a Event Handling .

	ActionListener (Button)
		actionPerformed()
	ItemListener (Choice, List,Checkbox ,Radio)
		itemStateChanged()
	MouseListener
		mousePressed()
		mouseReleased()
		mouseExited()
		mouseEnterd()
		mouseClicked()
	MouseMotionListener
		mouseMoved()
		mouseDragged()
	KeyListener (TextField, TextArea)
		keyTyped()
		keyPressed()
		keyReleased()
	WindowListener (Frame)
		windowActivated()
		windowClosing()
		windowClosed()
		windowIconified();
		windowDeIconified()
		windowOpened()
Also You have to register the component with appropriate Listener.
